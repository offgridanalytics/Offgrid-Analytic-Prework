Based on the data obtained from Kaggle.com. I shortlisted the method to carry on this analysis project and it definitely will involve time series because the focus of this project is to measure volatility against series of time. The aim of this project :

-1.	To evaluate the change on participant volume by year in GBP/USD
-2.	To identify the high & low volatility every specific of time
-3.	To understand the trend of market liquidity
